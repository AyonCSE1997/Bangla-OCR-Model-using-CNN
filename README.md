# Introduction 
This is my undergraduate project where i have built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model that can take ***122*** types of Bangla Handwritten Digit's and Character's image (including all compound characters)  as input and can recognize it with ***89%*** accuracy.
Model's training accuracy was ***100%***.



# Description

This projectâ€™s goal is to recognize Bangla handwritten digits and characters. By feeding an existing dataset
named Ekush-net into a proprietary CNN model, we were able to classify this dataset containing
***122*** sets of Bangla characters which are in total of ***184111***.Every picture was reshaped to suit inside the
Model. We utilized the final dataset to train the Model afterwards normalizing those photos and
we have achieved ***100%*** training accuracy. Our Model has a high level of accuracy rate of ***89%***
in recognizing Bangla characters.

Tool - Python, TensorFlow, Jupyter NoteBook
